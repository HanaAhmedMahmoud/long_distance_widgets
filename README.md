## Development Diary 
### 05/09/2025
- Set up project on github and on Xcode 
- Taught Phillip github commands, for his reference:
  git clone "link" -> adds repository to your main computer, only need to do this once. For the rest of the commands locate the folder in terminal
  git add . -> adds all folders/ new files/ assets you created 
  git commit -am "message -Name" -> creates a commit ready to push up to github
  git push -> pushes all your work to github
  git pull -> pulls down any changes i make or if you want the most updated version on computer 
- Initial coding of prototype completed by Hana, need to work on sorting out offsets
